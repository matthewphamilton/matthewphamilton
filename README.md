### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Matt and I am a research economist at Orygen, where I work on a range of modelling projects aimed at improving mental health outcomes for young people. My main focus is improving the quality and usefulness of mental health models through adopting modular, replicable and generalisable approaches to model development and validation.
